There is a map that will appear on the page
Once the user enters their zipcode or hits enter,  they will see markers appear on the map
The markers will have an event appear,an image of the band, the name of the event, with an embedded link to buying tickets at that venue



#Stretch Goals: 
City and zipcode input
Road trip feature to pick up your friends, stop and find something to eat
Make city feature work instead of just zipcode
Auto-fill and pre-populate “eg: Springfield VS Springfield IL vs Springfield St”
Build animated images in the app
Filter a “joke” image/giphy if nothing to do in your area comes up
Appending to the DOM in a more beautiful way

#Retrospective#
Check API in advance to be sure it doesnt mandate -CURL or does allow the AJAX call from a separate webpage
